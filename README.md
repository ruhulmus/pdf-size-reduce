PDF Size Reduce(compress) using Ghostscript at terminal. 
Here required 2 things for the process.

2. Installed `Ghostscript` in your machine

### Process

To reduce your pdf file you need to pass 3 parameters

./shrinkpdf.sh [inputfile] [outputfile] [resolution_in_dpi]

1. [inputfile] : Actual Filename of the PDF that is to be converted
2. [outputfile] : New filename of the converted PDF
3. [resolution_in_dpi] : The DPI (resolution) for the output PDF. 
Output resolution defaults is : 72 . You can use your own choice like 150 dpi , 150 dpi etc.

N.B: Lower DPI is better but the quality will be worse

### Execute and Reduce PDF

***Step 1 :  ***

Make the `shrinkpdf.sh` file executable and give it permissions to execute by  bellow command

  ``sudo chmod +x shrinkpdf.sh``

Now your `shrinkpdf.sh` file is executable.

***Step 2 :  ***

Now you can execute the the `shrinkpdf.sh`

`sudo ./shrinkpdf.sh sample-pdf.pdf output.pdf 150`

It will create a new file name `output.pdf` with 150dpi in same directory.

you can check the file size by below command.

``cmd
$ du -sh *
4.0K    README.md
124K    output.pdf
